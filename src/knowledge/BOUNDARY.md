# Knowledge and AI execution boundaries

- **Timeline** owns authoritative memory records and their identities. Captured `CharacterContext` defines permitted membership; the derived vector cache cannot add records.
- **Knowledge** (`knowledge/`) selects from the supplied snapshot using pure lexical ranking, cosine similarity of provider-returned vectors, and source-keyed fusion. The embedding port is defined here; it owns no model, worker process, model installation, credentials or GPU lifecycle.
- **AI adapters** (`adapters/`) implement external inference protocols. `GeminiEmbeddingProvider` lives here; an AI Engine IPC embedding adapter would also live outside the knowledge domain.
- **Request orchestration** (`request::MessageHandler`) chooses the configured KnowledgeRetrieval mode, awaits selection, and supplies the bounded prompt payload to the provider-neutral `GenerationRequest`. Cancellation and stale selection checks cover retrieval and generation as a single operation.
- **Generation** (`generation/`) dispatches provider-specific LLM requests and parses structured responses. `GeminiProvider` is one member of the `GenerationProvider` registry, not the shared generation engine. Provider-specific code never invokes retrieval.

Failures from semantic retrieval are explicit errors; the selected mode cannot silently fall back to lexical. Lexical mode is the explicit default until an embedding adapter is configured. No model runtime is linked into Core by this boundary refactor.
